addonsByMe is a collection of blender addons that I have created.
This allows better tracking of my work and issues to be reported
separate from the official contrib addons.

Some of these were originally added to https://github.com/sambler/myblendercontrib
All of these files will be merged into myblendercontrib to keep it
as one folder that gets used during the blender build process.
