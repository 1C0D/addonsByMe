addonsByMe is a collection of blender addons that I have created.
This allows better tracking of my work and issues to be reported
separate from the official contrib addons.

Some of these were originally added to https://github.com/sambler/myblendercontrib
All of these files will be merged into myblendercontrib to keep it
as one folder that gets used during the blender build process.

To get official blender source or binaries see http://blender.org
For my blender repo see https://github.com/sambler/myblender
